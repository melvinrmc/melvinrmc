- 👋 Hi, I’m @melvinrmc, I'm a software enginner.
- 👀 I’m interested in how innovation is adopted by people. You can read a fabulous book [here!](https://a.co/d/94y6L5x).
- 🚀 I'm impressed what people can do. I'm reading about the most incredible and memorable achivement [Men landing on the moon and bring them back](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sp-4102.pdf).
- 🌱 I’m Certified Kubernetes Administrator. Check my cert [here](https://www.credly.com/badges/e709d27e-8ee1-4b57-933e-38287a14c94f/linked_in?t=rd6f1e).
